    <h2>Welcome to my first website!</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Marlon, I'm an aspiring Frontend Developer from Cachoeirinha, 
        a city near Porto Alegre in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil</p>
    <h2>Why choose such a random name for a website?</h2>
    <p>I've seen it wrote on a t-shirt and though "WOW THAT'S SUPER COOL!".</p>
    <h2>What do I want to acomplish with this website?</h2>
    <p>First of all, this is a website to learn and practice HTML and CSS, 
        buying a domain and making the effort to put it on the web make it 
        more interesting to try new things while absorving more knowledge, and 
        worthwhile to mention, to improve my english writing skills!</p>
