    <h2>Welcome to my first website and training spot!</h2>
    <p>
      Hello, my name is Marlon, I'm an aspiring FrontEnd Developer from Porto
      Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil
    </p>

    <h2>Why choose such a random name for a website?</h2>
    <p>I've seen it wrote on a t-shirt and though "WOW THAT'S SUPER COOL!".</p>

    <h2>What do I want to acomplish with this website?</h2>
    <p>First of all, this is a website to learn and practice HTML and CSS.</p>
    <p>
      Buying a domain and making the effort to put it on the web make it more
      interesting to try new things while absorving more knowledge along the
      way.
